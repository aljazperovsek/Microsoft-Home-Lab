Inspiration For The Project 

I am excited to announce a new blog series that will focus on building a Microsoft Home Lab environment. Some time ago, I was searching for the best guidelines for setting up a Microsoft testing environment without additional hardware, but I couldnâ€™t find any. I found some concepts for complex labs that focused more on the networking side. So, I decided to build my test environment and share it with the public.
